that make all of this \n                                possible and a high level overview of the topics. We will start \n                                getting a general understanding of virtualization and hypervisors \n                                as well as their purpose and requirements. Then we will talk about \n                                cloud computing and the different models that agreed upon, highlighting \n                                who carries responsibility for each part of the service.</p>\n\n                                <blockquote>\n                                    <p>I don't need a hard disk in my computer if I can get to the server \n                                    faster ... carring around these non-connected is byzantine by comparison </p>\n                                    <cite>Steve Jobs</cite>\n                                </blockquote>\n                                \n                                <h2> Virtualization </h2>\n\n                                <h3> What is versutalization?</h3>\n\n                                <p>Generally speaking then we talk about virtualization we are referring to \n                                the process of running a virtual instance also known as a virtual machine \n                                (VM) in a layer abstracted from the the actual hardware. Moreover, we usually \n                                use virtualization to run multiple independent operating systems on one \n                                physical computer.  Essentially it it is the process of creating a simulated \n                                “virtual\" environment inside of a computer where you can run virtual machines.</p>\n\n                                <p>There are some terms which are commonly used which are important to discuss such as:</p>\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li> Virtual Machine (VM), which is nothing more than the software construct that allows \n                                    a user to run one or more operating systems on top of an existing operating system as \n                                    well as the name we give these machines themselves.</li>\n\n                                    <li>Guest OS, which is used interchangeably for virtual machine as a machine usually \n                                    requires using an Operating System (OS).</li>\n\n                                    <li>Host OS, which refers to the computer the Virtual machine is hosted on.</li>\n\n                                    <li>Hypervisor, which is the process and software that allows the host OS to \n                                    communicate with the guest OS.</li>\n                                </ul>\n\n                                <p>Additionally we can divide the use of virtualization into two categories; \n                                client-side virtualization and server-side virtualization, however, \n                                there are others such as application visualization which will not \n                                be covered here.</p>\n                                \n                                <h3>Client-side Virtualization</h3>\n\n                                <p>This refers to running one or more virtual machines on a personal or work station \n                                which can also referred to in the IT community as a thick client. Typically this is \n                                done using a type 2 hypervisor and can be on both a laptop or a desktop computer as \n                                long as the hardware can support virtualization. (We will talk about the requirements \n                                of visualization later in here). There are two cases where this can be extremely useful:</p>\n                                \n                                <ol>\n                                    <li>\n                                        Testing software applications that should run on several divergent operating \n                                        (Windows, Mac, Linux) and flavors of operating systems (Windows 7, Windows 10,  \n                                        and macOS Big Sur, MacOS Catelina, Ubunto, Fedora, etc.). This is particularly useful \n                                        when it is important to maintain backwards compatibility while pushing new software \n                                        updates.\n                                    </li>\n\n                                    <li>\n                                        Using software that is not available for your operating system wether it is \n                                        business applications of games. However, it is important to not that Mac virtual \n                                        machines can only be created on Mac hardware.\n                                    </li>\n                                </ol>\n\n                                <p>It is important to note that even if this has many practical applications, it is \n                                not a scalable solution or at least not efficiently.</p>\n                                \n                                <h3>Server-side Virtualization</h3>\n                                \n                                <p>This refers to running multiple virtual machines on a server which is simply a \n                                very powerful computer which provides functionality for other programs or devices \n                                which we call \"clients\". This is usually done with a type 1 hypervisor. The main \n                                use case here is to have one large computer that functions as the host for multiple \n                                virtual machines that are used by the employee of the organization in the organization. \n                                Additionally it is used when purchasing computing power from a cloud provider. Services \n                                such as storage space, web servers and computing instances. </p>\n\n                                <h3>The pursue of a Virtual Machine</h3>\n\n                                <p>It allows us to use our hardware resources more efficiently and would also allow more \n                                efficient allocation of capital resulting in a reduction in monetary spending. This \n                                refers to the fact that we can allocate pieces of hour host machine to the guest machines. \n                                In particular me the following resources: </p>\n\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li>CPU</li>\n                                    <li>RAM</li>\n                                    <li>Storage</li>\n                                    <li>Networking adapters</li>\n                                </ul>\n                                \n                                <p>\n                                    Additionally it is important to note that if we allocate hardware resources to a virtual \n                                    machine, to this guest OS it will appear as if it I its one Hardware. For example if we \n                                    allocate 2GB of RAM to a guest OS, it will appear to it that it has 2GR of RAM as if \n                                    it was its own hardware.  The same idea applies if we allocate it 1 core of the CPU and \n                                    other physical resources.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    Another purpose for the use of virtualization but in this case only for cloud services, \n                                    is rapid scalability. As it allows the the company to expand its resources much \n                                    faster and at a much lower cost.This applies both for scaling vertically, which \n                                    means to expanding the hardware capabilities of the VM’s and horizontally which \n                                    means to expand the number of VM's or computing instances. This will be explained \n                                    in more detail in the section on on cloud computing features.\n                                </p>\n\n                                <p>\n                                    As well as the pre-mentioned purposes of this technology we can also make use of its \n                                    isolation property. What is mean by this is that even tho the guest OS is on a host OS \n                                    where it is possible to host multiple other guest OS’s, the VM’s are isolated from each \n                                    other and from the host. Meaning that to each guest Os it appears as it if it has its \n                                    one hardware and is a standalone (non-virtual) machine. A benefit of this is that if \n                                    VM squires a virus, it does not effect the host OS or other guest OS. Meaning this VM \n                                    can be terminated with no harm done to the other OS’s, and its resources can be \n                                    allocated to a new VM with no harm done to the system. Nevertheless it is possible \n                                    to give OS communication abilities explicitly or as part of a Local Area Network (LAN). \n                                    This is also a massive benefit for testing as you can easily spin up (create), and \n                                    terminal (delete) VM to test an application\n                                </p>\n\n                                <h3>Hypervisors</h3>\n                                <p>\n                                    As hinted above a hypervisor is the process or software that makes virtual \n                                    machines possible. They are softwares that allow for the creation of these \n                                    virtual machines as well as allow the communication between the host OS and \n                                    the guest OS. However, it is important to not that not all hypervisor are the \n                                    same and generally speaking there are two types.\n                                </p>\n\n                                <h4>Type 1 Hypervisor</h4>\n                                <p>\n                                    This type of hypervisor is commonly referred to as bare metal hypervisor \n                                    do to its position on the tech-stack.
