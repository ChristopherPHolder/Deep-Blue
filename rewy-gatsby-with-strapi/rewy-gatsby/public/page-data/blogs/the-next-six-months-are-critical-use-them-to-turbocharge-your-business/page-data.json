But rather than simply adjust, think about the giant opportunity you now have to completely reboot--to take all the promise and unfulfilled potential of your team on a six-month journey toward 10x transformation.\n\nBefore the pandemic, you were hopeful, but hungry for fast and focused collaboration and constructive and candid discussion. You were eager, but impatient to see signs of agility from your senior team in the face of change--or to initiate disruptive change. The potential for exponential growth and unrealized innovation maybe felt just out of reach. Look back on the past six months and your team likely did some extraordinary things.\n\nBut what about the next six months? There will be great fortunes lost and great fortunes gained in this time of disruption. The world is still waiting for you to fundamentally transform. In the next six months, you and your team can take a 10-year leap forward. We are going to show you how to land it.\n\n1. The Future of High-Performance Teams: Co-Elevation\nImagine if the ownership of your organization's success switched from you, the leader, to your team--if your management overload were a shared load. The highest-performance teams we have coached at Ferrazzi Greenlight have delivered billions of dollars of value, ignited innovation, and accelerated growth. Why? They have a team-first approach. They practice safe candor, are committed to peer-to-peer co-creation and collaboration, offer a service mindset that cuts across silos, and have a relentless focus on results and winning--but winning together. Our research institute has spent 20 years defining the behaviors and practices behind these optimal teams--what I call co-elevation in my book Leading Without Authority.\n\nCo-elevation happens when a team is committed to organizational growth and team members are committed to one another: They climb higher together. They will challenge one another, give one another feedback, and coach one another. Accountability and productivity no longer need be the leader's burden, but will become a peer-to-peer attribute of how the team operates. Pivoting the business will emerge in the fabric of the team rather than waiting for the leader to call the play.\n\nThe move to new behavioral norms is called recontracting--the collective negotiation of a new team social contract. For example, failing to say what needs to be said in meetings is a low-integrity behavior that erodes value. To learn how to lead your team to commit to co-elevating behaviors, you can watch our recontracting video and get our recontracting white paper at keithferrazzi.com/recontract.\n\n2.
