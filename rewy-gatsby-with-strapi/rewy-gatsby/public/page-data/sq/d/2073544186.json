The key question for the justices in the consolidated cases (California v. Texas and Texas v. California): Can the law still stand if part of it is unconstitutional?\n\nPresident Trump's biggest legislative accomplishment--the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017--augured the aforementioned question, by striking the tax penalty for not having health coverage, a provision known as the individual mandate. Without that provision, the law may be undermined to the point that justices could toss it out entirely.\n\nThat will carry direct consequences for the 23 million Americans who are currently enrolled in insurance plans through the ACA's health care exchanges or receive coverage through Medicaid.\n\nLosing Obamacare could also pose downstream consequences for small businesses, says Robert Litan, an attorney and nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C. He warns that nullifying the law could trigger \"chaos in the insurance markets,\" and that instability could hit employers of all stripes. \n\nPrior to the pandemic, more than 150 million people in the U.S. got their health coverage through an employer. The law protects all Americans--even those covered by an employer--from caps that in the past had limited how much insurers or employers had to pay out in coverage each year, or over a lifetime. Taking the guardrails off could be jarring for all stakeholders and contribute to massive volatility, Litan says.\n\nAlthough the justices won't rule until next summer, three possibilities could emerge, depending who takes the White House:","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAARABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAABAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIBAwT/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQP/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAY2VnWcgAAP/xAAaEAEAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIDEyAi/9oACAEBAAEFAqAvgJhsVm3n/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIP/aAAgBAwEBPwEf/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIP/aAAgBAgEBPwEf/8QAHRAAAQIHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAhAhAREiCRwf/aAAgBAQAGPwJ0Xu5I1REQ1j//xAAdEAEAAQMFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABIQAxQRARIFFx/9oACAEBAAE/IUQtoj2kJBC5lp2+kUpAjFvH/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABAQ0EH/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg/9oACAEDAQE/EB//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg/9oACAECAQE/EB//xAAfEAACAgIBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAABIRExAEEQIFFhkaH/2gAIAQEAAT8QLGYu9Ml6gRc1JRxHQoHX31gNgQxwPc1ZwxKrz0f/2Q==","aspectRatio":1.1695906432748537,"src":"/static/3164c5ccb9b7af4e5e1d15e9e29629a4/9a128/1b8bac3d64533b52c457c05a71578a51.jpg","srcSet":"/static/3164c5ccb9b7af4e5e1d15e9e29629a4/f836f/1b8bac3d64533b52c457c05a71578a51.jpg 200w,\n/static/3164c5ccb9b7af4e5e1d15e9e29629a4/2244e/1b8bac3d64533b52c457c05a71578a51.jpg 400w,\n/static/3164c5ccb9b7af4e5e1d15e9e29629a4/9a128/1b8bac3d64533b52c457c05a71578a51.jpg 700w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}},"author":"Joe Bandon","date":"2020-10-25"},{"title":"Six Ways to Train Your Brain to Literally Get Smarter","slug":"six-ways-to-train-your-brain-to-literally-get-smarter","content":"In today's world, brain is worth more than brawn, and even ancient tricks can help. We live in a digital age surrounded by smart devices and connectivity, where everyone is trying to get smarter, faster. Plus, we're not just competing with humans anymore, thank you AI.\n\nWe have easy access to all kinds of information. The only way to stay ahead and be successful in life is to continue to get smarter and keep learning.\n\nTo some, this comes naturally and the ability to grasp complex concepts does not take much effort. Just because you're not naturally a \"genius\" doesn't mean you can't develop your intelligence through effort and dedication, though.\n\nStudies repeatedly show that you can make yourself smarter. High intelligence is nothing more than a great ability for pattern recognition and problem solving, all which is trainable.\n\nThe brain needs to work out similarly to how you exercise your physical muscles. Rigorous training, rest, and consistency will help you to improve your intelligence.\n\nBefore we begin, I want to discuss determined mentality. Sometimes you can be your worst enemy, and that can be the hardest obstacle to overcome. If you believe that your mind's ability won't change and its capacity is static, you might never be able to improve.\n\nIt's critical to think that you can learn, develop, and evolve with time and effort because that belief will motivate your mind.\n\n1. **Keep an intelligent company**\n2. **Read**\n3. **Rest**\n4. **Eat brain food**\n5. **Play brain games**\n6. **Keep a journal**","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/cab1485baba8309d043c59e2df51cd7d/9a128/878fb92587593c675478c7c67c61a9e5.jpg","srcSet":"/static/cab1485baba8309d043c59e2df51cd7d/f836f/878fb92587593c675478c7c67c61a9e5.jpg 200w,\n/static/cab1485baba8309d043c59e2df51cd7d/2244e/878fb92587593c675478c7c67c61a9e5.jpg 400w,\n/static/cab1485baba8309d043c59e2df51cd7d/9a128/878fb92587593c675478c7c67c61a9e5.jpg 700w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}},"author":"William Austin","date":"2020-10-18"},{"title":"The Next Six Months Are Critical: Use Them to Turbocharge Your Business","slug":"the-next-six-months-are-critical-use-them-to-turbocharge-your-business","content":"Most companies have adjusted to pandemic life--they've refitted their existing organization to the new environment. But rather than simply adjust, think about the giant opportunity you now have to completely reboot--to take all the promise and unfulfilled potential of your team on a six-month journey toward 10x transformation.\n\nBefore the pandemic, you were hopeful, but hungry for fast and focused collaboration and constructive and candid discussion. You were eager, but impatient to see signs of agility from your senior team in the face of change--or to initiate disruptive change. The potential for exponential growth and unrealized innovation maybe felt just out of reach. Look back on the past six months and your team likely did some extraordinary things.\n\nBut what about the next six months? There will be great fortunes lost and great fortunes gained in this time of disruption. The world is still waiting for you to fundamentally transform. In the next six months, you and your team can take a 10-year leap forward. We are going to show you how to land it.\n\n1. The Future of High-Performance Teams: Co-Elevation\nImagine if the ownership of your organization's success switched from you, the leader, to your team--if your management overload were a shared load. The highest-performance teams we have coached at Ferrazzi Greenlight have delivered billions of dollars of value, ignited innovation, and accelerated growth. Why? They have a team-first approach. They practice safe candor, are committed to peer-to-peer co-creation and collaboration, offer a service mindset that cuts across silos, and have a relentless focus on results and winning--but winning together. Our research institute has spent 20 years defining the behaviors and practices behind these optimal teams--what I call co-elevation in my book Leading Without Authority.\n\nCo-elevation happens when a team is committed to organizational growth and team members are committed to one another: They climb higher together. They will challenge one another, give one another feedback, and coach one another. Accountability and productivity no longer need be the leader's burden, but will become a peer-to-peer attribute of how the team operates. Pivoting the business will emerge in the fabric of the team rather than waiting for the leader to call the play.\n\nThe move to new behavioral norms is called recontracting--the collective negotiation of a new team social contract. For example, failing to say what needs to be said in meetings is a low-integrity behavior that erodes value. To learn how to lead your team to commit to co-elevating behaviors, you can watch our recontracting video and get our recontracting white paper at keithferrazzi.com/recontract.\n\n2.
