Here we will talk about the basic concepts that make all of this possible and a high level overview of the topics. We will start getting a general understanding of virtualization and hypervisors as well as their purpose and requirements. Then we will talk about cloud computing and the different models that agreed upon, highlighting who carries responsibility for each part of the service.\nVirtualization\nWhat is Virtualization? \nGenerally speaking then we talk about virtualization we are referring to the process of running a virtual instance also known as a virtual machine (VM) in a layer abstracted from the the actual hardware. Moreover, we usually use virtualization to run multiple independent operating systems on one physical computer.  Essentially it it is the process of creating a simulated “virtual\" environment inside of a computer where you can run virtual machines. \nThere are some terms which are commonly used which are important to discuss such as: \nVirtual Machine (VM), which is nothing more than the software construct that allows a user to run one or more operating systems on top of an existing operating system as well as the name we give these machines themselves. \nGuest OS, which is used interchangeably for virtual machine as a machine usually requires using an Operating System (OS).\nHost OS, which refers to the computer the Virtual machine is hosted on.\nHypervisor, which is the process and software that allows the host OS to communicate with the guest OS.\nAdditionally we can divide the use of virtualization into two categories; client-side virtualization and server-side virtualization, however, there are others such as application visualization which will not be covered here.\nClient-side Virtualization\nThis refers to running one or more virtual machines on a personal or work station which can also referred to in the IT community as a thick client. Typically this is done using a type 2 hypervisor and can be on both a laptop or a desktop computer as long as the hardware can support virtualization. (We will talk about the requirements of visualization later in here). There are two cases where this can be extremely useful:\nTesting software applications that should run on several divergent operating (Windows, Mac, Linux) and flavors of operating systems (Windows 7, Windows 10,  and macOS Big Sur, MacOS Catelina, Ubunto, Fedora, etc.). This is particularly useful when it is important to maintain backwards compatibility while pushing new software updates. \nUsing software that is not available for your operating system wether it is business applications of games. However, it is important to not that Mac virtual machines can only be created on Mac hardware. \nIt is important to note that even if this has many practical applications, it is not a scalable solution or at least not efficiently.\nServer-side Virtualization\nThis refers to running multiple virtual machines on a server which is simply a very powerful computer which provides functionality for other programs or devices which we call \"clients\". This is usually done with a type 1 hypervisor. The main use case here is to have one large computer that functions as the host for multiple virtual machines that are used by the employee of the organization in the organization. Additionally it is used when purchasing computing power from a cloud provider. Services such as storage space, web servers and computing instances. \nThe pursue of a Virtual Machine\nIt allows us to use our hardware resources more efficiently and would also allow more efficient allocation of capital resulting in a reduction in monetary spending. This refers to the fact that we can allocate pieces of hour host machine to the guest machines. In particular me the following resources: \nCPU\nRAM\nStorage\nNetworking adapters\nAdditionally it is important to note that if we allocate hardware resources to a virtual machine, to this guest OS it will appear as if it I its one Hardware. For example if we allocate 2GB of RAM to a guest OS, it will appear to it that it has 2GR of RAM as if it was its own hardware.  The same idea applies if we allocate it 1 core of the CPU and other physical resources. \nAnother purpose for the use of virtualization but in this case only for cloud services, is rapid scalability. As it allows the the company to expand its resources much faster and at a much lower cost.This applies both for scaling vertically, which means to expanding the hardware capabilities of the VM’s and horizontally which means to expand the number of VM's or computing instances. This will be explained in more detail in the section on on cloud computing features.\nAs well as the pre-mentioned purposes of this technology we can also make use of its isolation property. What is mean by this is that even tho the guest OS is on a host OS where it is possible to host multiple other guest OS’s, the VM’s are isolated from each other and from the host. Meaning that to each guest Os it appears as it if it has its one hardware and is a standalone (non-virtual) machine. A benefit of this is that if VM squires a virus, it does not effect the host OS or other guest OS. Meaning this VM can be terminated with no harm done to the other OS’s, and its resources can be allocated to a new VM with no harm done to the system. Nevertheless it is possible to give OS communication abilities explicitly or as part of a Local Area Network (LAN). This is also a massive benefit for testing as you can easily spin up (create), and terminal (delete) VM to test an application\nHypervisors\nAs hinted above a hypervisor is the process or software that makes virtual machines possible. They are softwares that allow for the creation of these virtual machines as well as allow the communication between the host OS and the guest OS. However, it is important to not that not all hypervisor are the same and generally speaking there are two types. \nType 1 Hypervisor\nThis type of hypervisor is commonly referred to as bare metal hypervisor do to its position on the tech-stack. It runs directly on the hardware and provides the best performance, however, it is generally only used for server-side virtualization. Some examples of type 1 hypervisors are: \nMicrosoft hyper-V\nVMware ESXi\nCitrix XenServer\nType 2 Hypervisor\nThis type of hypervisor is also known as host-based hypervisor, as it is installed on top of the existing host OS. It has lower performance and is not scalable, however, it is great for anyone wanting to learn more about hypervisors of different operating systems as it provided a very cheap way for users experiment. Some common examples of this type are: \nVMWare Fusion\nOracle VirtualBox\nQEMU (also an emulator)\nEmulator\nWhile talking about hypervisors it also seems important to mention what an emulator is and to make a clear differentiation. An emulator is a piece of software that enables the host computer to behave like a different computer which we refer to as guest. This is used to run software that was was designed for a specific and different piece of hardware. It is commonly used in for printers so that they emulate and HP LasorJet and are able to use its software. However, it is also typically used by game enthusiast which want to play classic video games and emulate the consoles on their computers. \nCloud Computing\nWhat is cloud computing? \nPut as simply as possible, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. These services may include servers, storage, databases, networking, software amount other. There are 3 commonly agreed upon types or models of cloud computing.\nSaaS - Software as a Service\nIt is an application run remotely, typically over a browser and most of use make use of them every day wether we are aware of them or not and many of them are free. Some examples are:\nGmail\nGoogle Drive\nMicrosoft Office\nThis model has the most responsibility for the vendor end least for the user of the product.\n\nPaaS - Platform as a Service\nThis model provides the user with an environment for the development of application. Some common examples are: \nHeroku\nGithub\nGoogle app engine \nThis model balances the responsibility between the user and the vendor. \n\nIaaS - Infrastructure as a Service\nIn this model the user has much more flexibility as how he uses the services, as what it does mainly is to provide the user with a computing infrastructure. Some common examples are: \nAWS - Amazon Web Services\nMicrosoft Azure\nCisco Metacloud\nThis model shift more of the responsibility away from the vendor and to the user.\n\nAdditionally when talking about the cloud it is also important to consider the common architectures. Out of which the 4 most common are: \nPublic\nIt is by fare the most common and it is as the name suggest cloud vendor that offers it services publicly and therefore every one has access to them. Some common examples are:\nAWS\nGoogle Cloud\nMicrosoft Azure\nPrivate\nFor this architecture the company owns and maintains everything, however, can provide additional security as it you have you have more control over how you data is handled and backed up. It is often called on-premises (on-prem) however it is possible to have the servers running in a server farm and still maintain complete ownership and responsibility. \nHybrid\nAs the name suggest it is a bit of both, you can keep your private information on-prem and move the rest of you computing requirements to a public cloud.\nCommunity\nA community cloud is a multi-tenant platform where several people and/or organizations can share computing resources. \nCloud computing features and issues\nThere are a couple defining features of cloud computing which can have a massive advantage to your organization. We will about a few here and describe them: \nShared resources\nThis refers to the fact that when using cloud computing you are often sharing resources with other users. These resources can be; Internal - which is also known as on-prem, or external, which is also known as cloud storage.\nRapid elasticity\nThis refers to the fact that many cloud computing services such as elastic-beam-stock, allow your computing resources to rapidly grow just as rapidly decrease matching the needs. This is quite useful when handling peak traffic on web applications, as you will require having more resources but only for a small period of time. \nOn demand\nThis refers to the fact that the resources are available when ever you need them and can be obtained extremely fast. \nResource pooling\nThis refers to the fact that to make this possible providers create large clusters of servers aggregating the computing power together. \nMeasured service\nCloud computing services are measured and you only pay for what you use, this often uses a system similar to meters to measure the services and then charges you at the end of the month. \n","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.1695906432748537,"src":"/static/3164c5ccb9b7af4e5e1d15e9e29629a4/9a128/1b8bac3d64533b52c457c05a71578a51.jpg","srcSet":"/static/3164c5ccb9b7af4e5e1d15e9e29629a4/f836f/1b8bac3d64533b52c457c05a71578a51.jpg 200w,\n/static/3164c5ccb9b7af4e5e1d15e9e29629a4/2244e/1b8bac3d64533b52c457c05a71578a51.jpg 400w,\n/static/3164c5ccb9b7af4e5e1d15e9e29629a4/9a128/1b8bac3d64533b52c457c05a71578a51.jpg 700w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}},"author":"Christopher Holder","date":"2020-10-25"},{"title":"Six Ways to Train Your Brain to Literally Get Smarter","slug":"six-ways-to-train-your-brain-to-literally-get-smarter","content":"In today's world, brain is worth more than brawn, and even ancient tricks can help.

Plus, we're not just competing with humans anymore, thank you AI.\n\nWe have easy access to all kinds of information. The only way to stay ahead and be successful in life is to continue to get smarter and keep learning.\n\nTo some, this comes naturally and the ability to grasp complex concepts does not take much effort. Just because you're not naturally a \"genius\" doesn't mean you can't develop your intelligence through effort and dedication, though.\n\nStudies repeatedly show that you can make yourself smarter. High intelligence is nothing more than a great ability for pattern recognition and problem solving, all which is trainable.\n\nThe brain needs to work out similarly to how you exercise your physical muscles. Rigorous training, rest, and consistency will help you to improve your intelligence.\n\nBefore we begin, I want to discuss determined mentality. Sometimes you can be your worst enemy, and that can be the hardest obstacle to overcome. If you believe that your mind's ability won't change and its capacity is static, you might never be able to improve.\n\nIt's critical to think that you can learn, develop, and evolve with time and effort because that belief will motivate your mind.\n\n1. **Keep an intelligent company**\n2. **Read**\n3. **Rest**\n4. **Eat brain food**\n5. **Play brain games**\n6. **Keep a journal**","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/cab1485baba8309d043c59e2df51cd7d/9a128/878fb92587593c675478c7c67c61a9e5.jpg","srcSet":"/static/cab1485baba8309d043c59e2df51cd7d/f836f/878fb92587593c675478c7c67c61a9e5.jpg 200w,\n/static/cab1485baba8309d043c59e2df51cd7d/2244e/878fb92587593c675478c7c67c61a9e5.jpg 400w,\n/static/cab1485baba8309d043c59e2df51cd7d/9a128/878fb92587593c675478c7c67c61a9e5.jpg 700w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}},"author":"William Austin","date":"2020-10-19"},{"title":"The Next Six Months Are Critical: Use Them to Turbocharge Your Business","slug":"the-next-six-months-are-critical-use-them-to-turbocharge-your-business","content":"Most companies have adjusted to pandemic life--they've refitted their existing organization to the new environment. But rather than simply adjust, think about the giant opportunity you now have to completely reboot--to take all the promise and unfulfilled potential of your team on a six-month journey toward 10x transformation.\n\nBefore the pandemic, you were hopeful, but hungry for fast and focused collaboration and constructive and candid discussion. You were eager, but impatient to see signs of agility from your senior team in the face of change--or to initiate disruptive change. The potential for exponential growth and unrealized innovation maybe felt just out of reach. Look back on the past six months and your team likely did some extraordinary things.\n\nBut what about the next six months? There will be great fortunes lost and great fortunes gained in this time of disruption. The world is still waiting for you to fundamentally transform. In the next six months, you and your team can take a 10-year leap forward. We are going to show you how to land it.\n\n1. The Future of High-Performance Teams: Co-Elevation\nImagine if the ownership of your organization's success switched from you, the leader, to your team--if your management overload were a shared load. The highest-performance teams we have coached at Ferrazzi Greenlight have delivered billions of dollars of value, ignited innovation, and accelerated growth. Why? They have a team-first approach. They practice safe candor, are committed to peer-to-peer co-creation and collaboration, offer a service mindset that cuts across silos, and have a relentless focus on results and winning--but winning together. Our research institute has spent 20 years defining the behaviors and practices behind these optimal teams--what I call co-elevation in my book Leading Without Authority.\n\nCo-elevation happens when a team is committed to organizational growth and team members are committed to one another: They climb higher together. They will challenge one another, give one another feedback, and coach one another. Accountability and productivity no longer need be the leader's burden, but will become a peer-to-peer attribute of how the team operates. Pivoting the business will emerge in the fabric of the team rather than waiting for the leader to call the play.\n\nThe move to new behavioral norms is called recontracting--the collective negotiation of a new team social contract. For example, failing to say what needs to be said in meetings is a low-integrity behavior that erodes value. To learn how to lead your team to commit to co-elevating behaviors, you can watch our recontracting video and get our recontracting white paper at keithferrazzi.com/recontract.\n\n2.
