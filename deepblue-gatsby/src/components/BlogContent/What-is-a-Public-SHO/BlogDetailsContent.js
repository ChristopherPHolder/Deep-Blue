                                of any kind on EVM compatible chains. However, this access can also be compared to a 
                                Freemium model, where switching to a Premium model means holding DAO and getting full 
                                access to a DAO SHO. This means that projects launched on DAO Pad will benefit from 
                                potentially billions of dollars and massive exposure.</p>
