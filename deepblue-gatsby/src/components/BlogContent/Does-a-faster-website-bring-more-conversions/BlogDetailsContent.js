                                <p>
                                Every business owner wants to bring in more leads, customers 
                                and generate lots of conversions. That’s great, but it also 
                                comes with some pressure. Lead generation and bringing conversions 
                                can be difficult, expensive, and also time-consuming. However, 
                                in recent years, many have connected the idea of having a faster 
                                website with bringing in more conversions and paid customers. 
                                Which does make you wonder, can you generate more sales if you 
                                have a fast website? Let’s find out!

                                    Around 40% of website visitors will go to another website 
                                    if yours takes more than 3 seconds to load.

                                    52% of online shopping enthusiasts state that their brand 
                                    loyalty depends on how fast the website is.
                                    </li>

                                    14% of customers will start shopping from your competitors 
                                    if your website is slow.
                                    </li>

                                    64% of those unhappy with your website will not come back, 
                                    and they will go to another website to shop next time.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                If your website is not loading fast, then you automatically start 
                                losing conversions. A study from &nbsp;

                                seconds of website loading time are crucial. Ideally, you want 
                                your website to load within 2 seconds or less. This provides 
                                the optimal user experience and the best conversion rates. The 
                                slower your website is, the fewer conversions you will have. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Based on the Portent study, if you have a website that loads 
                                within a second, you get around 31.79% as a conversion rate. 
                                Anything around a second has a 20.22% conversion rate, then 2 
                                seconds will bring 13.93%, with 3 offering 13.74%. Once you start 
                                going over 4 seconds, the conversion rate will be 12% or less. If 
                                you’re looking to improve transaction conversions, you want to have up 
                                to 2 seconds as a loading time. Anything over that will affect the 
                                user experience and your bottom line. It’s normal for the website

                                <p>

                                study </a> showing that around 70% of consumers 
                                are affected by page speed. They might not be willing to buy from 
                                an online retailer that’s very slow and doesn’t have breakneck speeds. 
                                It’s imperative to keep in mind that you need to optimize the website 
                                speed to achieve excellent conversion rates. If not, customers will go 
                                to your competitors for a better user experience.
                                </p>

                                It would be best if you thought about this from a user perspective. 
                                Would you trust to buy from a website that barely loads? Would you share 
                                your payment information or anything similar to that with a slow website? 
                                Let’s face it, slow websites don’t inspire any trust, and that becomes a 
                                problem. The best thing that you can do is to improve your website speed, 
                                and people will trust you a lot more.

                                <h4> Does this affect the e-commerce world? </h4>
                                <p>
                                Every website is affected by its loading speed. That’s especially true for 
                                e-commerce websites, where customers are actively buying products or services. 
                                </p>

                                <h3>Will you have higher bounce rates if your website is slower?</h3>
                                <p>
                                Absolutely, and there’s a reason for that. &nbsp; 
                                <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/page-load-time-statistics/"

                                 Google</a> themselves stated that the 
                                probability of having a higher bounce rate increases by around 32% if the load 
                                time goes from 1 to 3 seconds. What that means is that anything over 1 second 
                                of loading time can affect your bounce rates. In this case, just 2 seconds more 
                                can bring in a 1/3 increase in bounce rates. That’s very problematic for your 
                                website since the main focus is to capture that traffic’s attention and bring in 
                                more conversions. It will take some trial and error to achieve that, but the 
                                experience can be staggering if it’s all handled appropriately.

                                <h3>Is it possible to suffer losses if your website speed becomes lower?</h3>
                                <p>
                                Yes, usually, the faster your website is, the better. A &nbsp;
                                <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1825005/how-one-second-could-cost-amazon-16-billion-sales"

                                FastCompany</a> study shows 
                                that if Amazon had their website slower with just a single second, they might lose 
                                around $1.6 billion. Sure, the losses are not as severe for less popular websites, 
                                but everyone experiences losses from a slow-loading website. This is why your primary 
                                focus is to identify how to increase website speed and figure out the proper methods to 
                                achieve all these goals properly. Implementing these ideas is very helpful, and it can 
                                provide extraordinary potential.

                                <p>
                                We live in the age of speed, and we must realize that everyone wants tasks like visiting a 
                                website or completing an order to happen very fast. If that’s not the case, you will end 
                                up with problems. Speed governs the internet, and it does influence the user experience 
                                for visitors. After all, Mozilla acquired more than 60 million downloads for their browser 
                                simply by making their pages faster by 2.2 seconds. And Amazon, which we mentioned earlier, 
                                is a leader in online sales because it provides direct access to pretty much any item you 
                                would need, all while delivering a stellar, fast website infrastructure.

                                <p>
                                Yes, website speed is one of the SEO factors that you need to keep in mind. The reality 
                                is that fast websites tend to be ranked much higher when compared to slow websites. That 
                                dictates the amount of traffic you receive from the web, which is extremely important. 
                                Ranking higher is a priority for all of us, and the higher you rank, the more website 
                                visitors you get. Of course, more traffic leads to a higher number of conversions, so it’s 
                                imperative to speed up your website as much as possible. Using the right methods to increase 
                                website speed is crucial, and results can be staggering every time.

                                <h3>How can you increase website speed and boost your conversion rate?</h3>
                                <h4>Enable compression</h4>
                                <p>
                                It’s a great idea to try and enable compression and use a tool like Gzip to lower the size of 
                                your JavaScript, HTML, or CSS files. It’s essential not to use this tool for image files. 
                                Instead, you will tackle those separately. Still, compressing files can help you save a lot 
                                of space, leading to a much faster loading time for your website. That alone can make a huge 
                                difference, and you will rank higher as a result.
                                </p>
                                <h4> Minifying your code </h4>
                                <p>
                                This means optimizing your code to remove unnecessary characters like commas, spaces, etc. 
                                Cleaning up your code can also lead to the website loading up a whole lot faster as a 
                                result. While there, you also want to remove code comments, unused code, and formatting. 
                                According to Google, the best tools you can use for this task would be UglifyJS and CSSNano. 
                                Optimizing the code also shows you care about the overall website structure and it also makes 
                                things a lot easier if you’re enhancing your website in the future.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Use a CDN</h4>
                                <p>
                                The role of a content distribution network is to help deliver content from a server 
                                close to the user’s home. What this does is it speeds up the loading time, and that 
                                will rank your website higher. It also means your users will have a much better 
                                experience, translating into a higher conversion rate. It’s a clever idea to use a 
                                CDN since they usually have data centers worldwide, and you can guarantee faster 
                                loading times for all your website visitors.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Image optimization</h4>

                                Changing the image format from PNG to JPG is an excellent idea since JPG requires 
                                a lot less space on your server. That being said, you may lose some image quality, 
                                yet in the end, what matters is making sure your images don’t take ages to load. 
                                If you have an image-focused website, this simple idea can bring fantastic benefits. 
                                It’s imperative to try and optimize all your images individually. There are tools 
                                that can do bulk optimization, but taking care of every image individually helps 
                                you ensure its quality.

                                <h4>Make the most out of browser caching</h4>
                                <p>
                                Browser caching is an excellent tool because most browsers cache website info 
                                locally to speed up loading times. Tools like YSlow can be used to see if you 
                                have any expiration date for the cache or not. The expiration date is a year 
                                unless you make changes very often. 
                                </p>
                                <h4>Ensure that you have fewer redirects</h4>
                                <p>
                                Whenever you redirect people to other pages, that counts as an additional 
                                waiting time for the user. You want to prevent that, so having fewer 
                                redirects is extremely important. That’s certainly something to consider, 
                                especially if you have a website linking to other sites and creations.
                                </p>
