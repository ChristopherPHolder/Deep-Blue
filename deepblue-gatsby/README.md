# deepblue-gatsby
The front-end of the unauthenticated website, built on react js with gatsby and scss

Changes to the style are made in in style.scss and implemented by converting the file into a css file in the comand line.

You must first cd into ./src/assets/css/

The comand to convert the file is:

    % sass style.scss style.css

If located on the root directory you can also run: 

    % cd src/assets/css && sass style.scss style.css && cd ../../../
